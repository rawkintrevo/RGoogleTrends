# To Do:

## Initial
- [ ] Upload Wiki
- [ ] Package

## Upgrades
- [ ] Make keywords load from a list (instead of a .csv).  This will probably require doing some guess and check my the script its self (probably an entire sequence)
- [ ] Create function that given average annual search volume (from Adwords) entire matrix of volume can be solved. 
- [ ] Verify volumes against adwords. (Get an idea of margin of error).
